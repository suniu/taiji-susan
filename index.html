	<h1>What is Taiji?</h1>
	<p>Taiji Quan (Tai Chi Chuan) is a time-tested art which gently exercises the body, the energy flow, and the mind, and can be used for health, longevity, mental freshness, and spiritual development. Taiji Quan aims at well-being, including the attainment of grace and balance, the promotion of physical and emotional health, and the development of energy flow. Though there are many varieties of Taiji Quan today, all have a common philosophy of relaxation of the mind and body so the body's natural energy can flow freely.<br><br>
	Taiji Quan, which means supreme ultimate boxing, was developed in the 17th century by Zhang San Feng, a Taoist monk who believed that martial arts practitioners need not exert physical energy when performing techniques. Instead, he believed that relaxation of the mind and body when facing confrontation would allow a practitioner to neutralize any attack.<!-- <br><br>
	Many people believe that Taiji Quan is not a martial art at all, but just an exercise for relaxation or health. Actually, Taiji Quan is a particular style of Chinese Kung Fu, and is often referred to as an internal or soft style of martial arts. In reality, while it does emphasize internal development, Taiji Quan, like all styles of Chinese martial arts, contains both internal and external, hard and soft components. -->
